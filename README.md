# WheelOFun

The project took around 22 hours to build.
I wanted to use entity system but it required a more complex gameplay (Slots) which would have taken me more than 48 hours to finish.
The project lacks garbage collection and dispose functionality.
Didn't have enough time to implement a proper dialog system.
